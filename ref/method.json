Separately, these interventions increase academic and social-emotional development as well as future employability and economic potential. We uniquely combine these to maximize their collective effectiveness. Through weekly after-school music and art instruction, mentoring, trauma-informed care, and performance opportunities across Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, GOGO is a platform for youth to learn, grow and unleash their leadership potential.",
